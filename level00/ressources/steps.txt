First, we verified which files the user flagg00 had permissions for.
For this, we used the cmd:

find / -user flag00

which gave us the file:

/rofs/usr/sbin/john

With the content:
cdiiddwpgswtgt

We used https://www.dcode.fr/chiffre-cesar

To check Ceasar's cipher we get "nottoohardhere"

Which is the password for flag00.
